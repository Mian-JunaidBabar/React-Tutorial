# React Projects Collection

This repo contains multiple small React projects I built while learning React from [Bro Code](https://www.youtube.com/@BroCodez). Each project helped me understand core concepts like components, props, hooks (like `useState`, `useEffect`), and how to structure React apps using Vite.

## How to Run

1. Open any project folder
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
